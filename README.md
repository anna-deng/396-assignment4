![Demo](396-a4-demo.gif)

This interactive explorable explanation describes the digestive processes that take place when we consume sugar. It is divded into three sections: 
- Sugar overview: to help users understand the different types of sugars we consume.
- Step-by-Step walkthrough of the sugar digestive process: to help users understand the process that occurs in our digestive system to break down the consumed sugar.
- Effects of sugar: to help users understand the repercussions of sugar consumption, particularly, overconsumption of sugar which many Americans struggle with.

This guide is aimed at the general public – no prior knowledge/experience is necessary.
